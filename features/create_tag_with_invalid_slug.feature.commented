Scenario: As user I login and create a tag with invalid slug.
    Given I login
    And I navigate to the "create tag" functionality
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    When I enter tag name "Tag name"
    And I enter tag "slug" with 192 characters
    And I save the tag
    Then I should see tag saving "error"
